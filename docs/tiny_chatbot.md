Hey, coder! I hear you—let's strip this down to a bite-sized, Flask-free version that's easy to grok. Imagine this as a tiny chatbot sandwich: just the meaty prompt engineering, no extra toppings. We'll keep the personas and few-shot examples, but ditch the web server and session stuff for a simple command-line toy. Ready? 🍔🚀

### Shortened Python Code: `tiny_chatbot.py`
Here's a concise version—about 50 lines—that focuses on the core prompt engineering magic from Section 3. No Flask, no JSON, just pure Python fun!

[tiny_chatbot.py](../tiny_chatbot.py)

### What's Happening Here? 🧠
- **Personas**: Pick a vibe (expert, friendly, etc.)—it's like choosing your chatbot's personality! 🎭
- **Few-Shot Examples**: Tiny Q&A pairs teach the bot how to reply—think of it as a cheat sheet. 📝
- **Question Classifier**: A simple “what/how/think” check to grab the right example—crude but quick! ⚡
- **Prompt Maker**: Slaps the persona and example into a prompt—your bot's script. 🎬
- **Chat**: Ties it all together and talks back—short and sweet! 💬

### How to Run It
1. Replace the `your_*` bits in the `llm` setup with your Azure OpenAI credentials (check your `.env` file from the tutorial).
2. Save as `tiny_chatbot.py`.
3. Run `python tiny_chatbot.py`—boom, three test responses pop out! 🎉

This is like a mini chatbot engine—no web fuss, just the core idea. Play with it, tweak the personas, or ask it silly questions. Want to dig deeper into any part? Hit me up! 😄
