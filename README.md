## üîê Authentication Flow

```bash
# Register a new user
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"alice", "password":"secret"}'

# Login and receive auth token
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"alice", "password":"secret"}'
```

Use the returned token in all future requests via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

---

## üß† Example Chat Flow

```bash
# Ask a question
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ask \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is the capital of Switzerland?"}'

# Continue with a persona
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ask \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Tell me something cool about it.", "persona": "friendly"}'
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install flask langchain openai

# Set environment variables
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
export OPENAI_API_VERSION="2023-05-15"

# Start the app
python app_multiuser.py  # or app.py for basic version
```

## ‚úÖ Shell Test Scripts

Each major module has a matching shell script (not shown here) that includes cURL-based API tests. Great for verifying:
- Authentication
- Chat memory
- Persona behavior
- Conversation persistence

Run them from your terminal to simulate real-world usage.

## üéØ Use Cases

- üß™ Prototype chatbot UIs or assistant backends
- üß∞ Develop and test LangChain memory chains
- üßë‚Äçüíª Practice secure API design with authentication
- ü§π Experiment with persona-aware LLM behaviors

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Some Python modules in this repository are partial implementations or work-in-progress stubs. You may encounter placeholder functions, incomplete classes, or redundant components (e.g., `prompt_engineering1.py`, `user_authentication.py`). These are included for development transparency and future extension.
